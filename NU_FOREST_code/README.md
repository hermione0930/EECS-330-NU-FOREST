# What Does Earth-Colder Do?
Global warming is a prolonged environmental issue that needs urgent actions. We are surpring to know that deforestration adds more carbon dioxide to atmosphere, one of the major reason that causes Global Warming, than the sum of commuting emission on road. Therefore, we think figuring out how to stop deforestration is the primary concern in solve Global Warming issues.

## Problem Statement
What we want to achieve is to not only provide a way for common people to help planting trees in needing area despite of their financial situations but also remind and encourage them in their everday life to conduct pro-environment actions and constantly pay attention to how they can help with Global Warming and Deforestration issues. So, we want to create a virtual place where people can grow a virtual tree by doing pro-environmental activities.
