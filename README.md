# EECS-330-NU-FOREST
What we want to achieve is to not only provide a way for common people to help planting trees in needing area despite of their financial situations but also remind and encourage them in their everday life to conduct pro-environment actions and constantly pay attention to how they can help with Global Warming and Deforestration issues. So, we want to create a virtual place where people can grow a virtual tree by doing pro-environmental activities.
